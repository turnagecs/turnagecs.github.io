<br>
<p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Business Administration with an economics degree. I hope to find a career where I can show my skill working with and drawing conclusions from data in an in-house analytics role, helping our business run more efficiently and profitably. I love working with data to understand problems and gain insights into how to solve them. </p>
<p>I have experience with software packages such as R, Stata, EViews and SPSS, which have been integrated into my coursework in Economics, giving me a competitive edge in the industry. Leadership experience I've gained working as a counselor at Nebraska Lutheran Outdoor Ministries has taught and honed important values critical to success in the business world.
